## Dance-of-Bullets v1.0.0 (alpha) - uwp branch
![](Images/logo.png)

My micro-RnD of Dance-of-Bullets (Fast and ultra dynamic action game when you need to destroy every squares and protect yours)) shooter platformer smaple :)

My main goal is/was: adaptation for W10M (Astoria included). 
And second (goal): add some "virtual pad" =)


## My 2 cents (status)
- Project's compiling - ok at now ;)
- W10M UWP adaptation init...
- VS 2017 (IDE) compatibility for best W10M debug process (?)
- Min. W10M build: 10240 (hello, Astoria!)
- Work-in-progress (Config/Storage handling, etc.)

## DoB Project Explanation (words from the author)
"Dance of Bullets is a bullet hell shmup I worked on mostly in 2012 using the XNA framework, mostly driven by the fact that there weren't many games in this genre on the PC outside japan at the time. (And / or they were hard to access.) This isn't an issue anymore as Steam became more open to submissions, so I slowly stopped developing DoB, especially as support for XNA has been ended by Microsoft." -Dániel Kis-Nagy

## How to build it
- fork my solution
- open it with VS 2022 preview
- Start /Launch it and catch 100500 bugs, hehe! :)

## ToDo
- Fix screen auto-scaling (known bug: only half of game drawn on my Lumia 940 with W10M Astoria)))
- Realize some menu, and normal game exit after game over ;))
