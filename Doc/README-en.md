My micro-RnD of Bullets-Defender (Fast and ultra dynamic action game when you need to destroy every squares and protect yours))

##Bullets Defender - Explanation
Use your slingshot to burst the maximum number of blocks that want to destroy yours! The more you pull on the rope, the higher the projectile will go. The game ends if you no longer have a small white square! So try to make the best score :) 

- This game is played only with the mouse.

- The key 1 and 3 of the numeric pad on your keyboard allows you to reduce / increase the size of the window. However, it launches at the maximum size at the start, so you can especially reduce if it is too big for your machine.

This game could be ported to mobile if you think you might like it!

- Gamecoder Premium student : 10/22/2018, my username is Hydrogen

- Language and Framework used: C# / MonoGame + (my toolbox inspired by Haxeflixel to develop faster) : https://www.gamecodeur.fr/projets/construction-outils-monogame/

- Code / Grapshimes / Music: Everything is done by myself for once! (At the same time the graphics are just squares huh...) and the music is made with FL Studio, I chose to use the "instruments" of the Gameboy.

- Use of external libraries and codes: The only thing that I reuse in all my MonoGame projects is my mini-lib that I created as part of the Gamecoder training which makes my life easier on all points (I arrive at the same production speed that Haxeflixel could offer me for comparison)

- Time spent: About ten hours spread over 2 days.

- Small postmortem (opinion on the language / framework used, difficulties, successes, choices, quick personal assessment, etc...) : 

Regarding C#/Monogamous, today it has undoubtedly become my favorite combination of language/framework to create my games, I just can't live without it anymore, I even think I could stay on it all my life haha, I'm super comfortable and I need nothing more, whereas yet at first, I didn't like it at all, because it had nothing at all (Monogamous is empty!) But when we start to fill it with our own way of thinking, it quickly becomes the most fabulous tool for coding, because we shape it in our image :)

For this jam, I wanted to get together with my worst enemy and settle his score once and for all: The trigo! You should know that I hated using Cosine/Sine /Tangent functions, and I chose to code a small game prototype (which I would be ready to port to mobile if you like it, we'll see!) which will force me to use the trigo. To manage the angle of the slingshot, the direction of the shot, the strength of the elastic band etc. I spent clearly half of my time understanding this, and the other half actually doing the game ^^ 

This game is mainly a revenge against the trigo, because I am the one who coded the combat system of Lost Colonies Gamecoder Student Edition, except that I had quite a problem with the angle of the soldier's shot and it was S3rval, the project manager, who saved me the day on this shot and gave me the indications of understanding of my mistake. In any case, after the trigger, the next enemy to burst the face: C++, I'm coming!

I take great pleasure in adding a lot of effects of "Juice", "polish", and "particles" as we like to call them, I hope you will notice all this, it is clearly a big part of the time spent on all this :) 

I didn't have much time to devote to it, you know I'm still working on my big project Always The Same Nightmare (whose last devlog was recently released https://www.gamecodeur.fr/devlogs/59343 / about the returns of the game on the arcade terminal) . So I hope that despite a game made in 10 hours, you will like it anyway!

## How to build it
- fork my solution
- open it with VS 2022 preview
- Start /Launch it and do the best score! :)
